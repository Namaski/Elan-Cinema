*Project built using vanilla PHP*

# Filmopedia

A website that catalogs movies organized in a database.\
This project follows an MVC\* pattern, with HTTP requests routing arguments through the URL.

*This project is still in progress. It will eventually support features such as:*

- Displaying views for:
  - An individual or multiple individuals (actors or directors).
  - A movie or multiple movies.
  - Sorting movies by genre.
  - Listing all movie genres.
  - Displaying the cast of a movie.
- Each movie will include a title, release date, poster, summary, a single director, one or more genres, and the actors who appeared in it.
- An administrative section to manage data, enabling the creation, modification, and deletion of movies and individuals.

\* *Note: MVC = Model-View-Controller*
