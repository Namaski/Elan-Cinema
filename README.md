# Elan-CINEMA Filmopedia
A website that catalogs movies grouped in a database.
Here we employ an MVC* pattern, with HTTP requests redirecting arguments in the URL.

* This project is still in progress but, it will be possible to display views for:

    * An individual or multiple individuals (actor or director)
    * A movie or multiple movies
    * Sorting movies by genre
    * Listing all movie genres
    * The casting of a movie
    * A movie possesses a title, a release date, a poster, a summary, a single director, one or several genres, and actors who have appeared in the film.

* The website will also include an administrative section allowing the manipulation of the data: creating, modifying, or deleting a movie, similarly for individuals.

\* Note: MVC = Model-View-Controllers
